Application Link:
https://population-prediction-for-western-balkan-countries.streamlit.app/

This Streamlit app predicts the population of Western Balkan countries using various machine learning models. The app allows users to select different models and visualize predictions up to the year 2045.

## Features

- Predict population using:
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Linear Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Decision Tree Regression
- Visualize predictions with interactive plots.
- Compare model performances using RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Styled with a custom CSS theme.
